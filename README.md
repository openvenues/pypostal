pypostal
--------

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/postal.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/postal) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/openvenues/pypostal.svg)](https://github.com/openvenues/pypostal/blob/master/LICENSE)

These are the official Python bindings to https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal, a fast statistical parser/normalizer for street addresses anywhere in the world.

Usage
-----

```python
from postal.expand import expand_address
expand_address('Quatre vingt douze Ave des Champs-Élysées')

from postal.parser import parse_address
parse_address('The Book Club 100-106 Leonard St, Shoreditch, London, Greater London, EC2A 4RH, United Kingdom')
```

Installation
------------

Before using the Python bindings, you must install the libpostal C library. Make sure you have the following prerequisites:

**On Ubuntu/Debian**
```
sudo apt-get install curl autoconf automake libtool python-dev pkg-config
```
**On CentOS/RHEL**
```
sudo yum install curl autoconf automake libtool python-devel pkgconfig
```
**On Mac OSX**
```
brew install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```

**Installing libpostal**

If you're using an M1 Mac, add --disable-sse2 to the ./configure command. This will result in poorer performance but the build will succeed.

```
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal
cd libpostal
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=[...some dir with a few GB of space...]
make
sudo make install

# On Linux it's probably a good idea to run
sudo ldconfig
```

To install the Python library, just run:

```
pip install postal
```

**Installing libpostal on Windows**

Install [msys2](http://msys2.org) and launch a shell using the `MSYS2 MingW 64-bit` start menu option, **not** the usual `MSYS2 MSYS` option.
This is important because we don't want our `libpostal.dll` to [link to](https://www.davidegrayson.com/windev/msys2/) `msys-2.0.dll` (Python seems to hang if you load this DLL).

Then:
```
pacman -S autoconf automake curl git make libtool gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal
cd libpostal
cp -rf windows/* ./
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=[...some dir with a few GB of space...]
make
make install
mkdir headers && cp -r /usr/include/libpostal/ headers/
```

Now start a command prompt which has access to the Microsoft toolchain. This can be done by e.g. installing the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk) and then running the ``x64 Native Tools Command Prompt``.

Assuming your MSYS and Python are installed in some standard locations, you can use this command prompt to build+install the Python library like so:
```
lib.exe /def:libpostal.def /out:postal.lib /machine:x64
pip install postal --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I[...libpostal checkout...]\headers" --global-option="-L[...libpostal checkout...]"
copy src\.libs\libpostal-1.dll "C:\Python36\Lib\site-packages\postal\libpostal.dll"
```

Compatibility
-------------

pypostal supports Python 3.5+. These bindings are written using the Python C API and thus support CPython only. Since libpostal is a standalone C library, support for PyPy is still possible with a CFFI wrapper, but is not a goal for this repo.

Tests
-----

Make sure you have [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) installed, then run:

```
pip install -e .
pytest postal/tests
```

The ```pip installe -e .``` business is needed so the C extensions build and are accessible/importable by the Python modules.
